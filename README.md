# tumblr-theme

  Hey Dan! I hope you like your new theme. There are a few quick things you need to do:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Click on the file 'dan-theme' in a new tab, then click the 'raw' button. Hit command-a then command-c to copy all code
    </li>
    <li>
      Go to your tumblr blog and click on the palette button in the upper right corner
    </li>
    <li>
      Go to 'edit html' and hit command-a then command-v to replace your old code with the new code. You can preview it first to know I'm not trolling you :) then hit save
    </li>
    <li>
      Add your avatar pic twice. So first under 'appearance options' and then again under 'theme options'
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn ON 'infinte scrolling' under 'theme options' and save
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Optional: if you want to edit your cover image I've included a link to the eclipse I'm using in the actual html code itself. You can find it under the head section. Copy that link and save the image. Then upload that image to 'cover' under 'theme options' and save
    </li>
    <li>
      Optional: If the mog gifs are too cringe you can turn off the puzzle feature by turning ON 'hide eclipse puzzle' under 'theme options', then save and exit.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  That's it! Enjoy! <br>
